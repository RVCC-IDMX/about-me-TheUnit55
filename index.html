      <h2>Destroyer of Worlds Quote - Oppenheimer</h2>

      <div>

        <p>AS HE WITNESSED the first detonation of a nuclear weapon on July 16,
          1945, a piece of Hindu scripture ran through the mind of J.
          Robert Oppenheimer: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.”
          It is, perhaps, the most well-known line from the Bhagavad
          Gita, but also the most misunderstood.</p>


        <p>Oppenheimer, the subject of a new film from director Christopher Nolan,
          died at the age of 62 in Princeton, New Jersey,
          on February 18, 1967. As wartime head of the Los Alamos Laboratory,
          the birthplace of the Manhattan Project, he is rightly
          seen as the “father” of the atomic bomb. “We knew the world would not be the same,”
          he later recalled. “A few people laughed,
          a few people cried, most people were silent.”</p>


        <p>Oppenheimer, watching the fireball of the Trinity nuclear test, turned
          to Hinduism. While he never became a Hindu in the
          devotional sense, Oppenheimer found it a useful philosophy to structure his life around.
          “He was obviously very attracted to
          this philosophy,” says Stephen Thompson, who has spent more than 30 years studying
          and teaching Sanskrit. Oppenheimer’s interest
          in Hinduism was about more than a sound bite, Thompson argues. It was a way of making
          sense of his actions.</p>


        <p>The Bhagavad Gita is 700-verse Hindu scripture, written in Sanskrit, that
          centers on a dialog between a great warrior prince named
          Arjuna and his charioteer Lord Krishna, an incarnation of Vishnu. Facing an
          opposing army containing his friends and relatives,
          Arjuna is torn. But Krishna teaches him about a higher philosophy that will
          enable him to carry out his duties as a warrior
          irrespective of his personal concerns. This is known as the dharma, or holy
          duty. It is one of the four key lessons of the
          Bhagavad Gita, on desire or lust; wealth; the desire for righteousness, or dharma;
          and the final state of total liberation, moksha.</p>



        <p>Seeking his counsel, Arjuna asks Krishna to reveal his universal form.
          Krishna obliges, and in verse 12 of the Gita he manifests
          as a sublime, terrifying being of many mouths and eyes. It is this moment that
          entered Oppenheimer’s mind in July 1945. “If the
          radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky, that would be
          like the splendor of the mighty one,” was
          Oppenheimer’s translation of that moment in the desert of New Mexico.</p>


        <p>In Hinduism, which has a non-linear concept of time, the great god is involved
          in not only the creation, but also the dissolution.
          In verse 32, Krishna says the famous line. In it “death” literally translates as
          “world-destroying time,” says Thompson, adding
          that Oppenheimer’s Sanskrit teacher chose to translate “world-destroying time” as
          “death,” a common interpretation. Its meaning
          is simple: Irrespective of what Arjuna does, everything is in the hands of the divine.</p>


        <p>“Arjuna is a soldier, he has a duty to fight. Krishna, not Arjuna, will determine who
          lives and who dies and Arjuna should neither
          mourn nor rejoice over what fate has in store, but should be sublimely unattached to such
          results,” says Thompson. “And ultimately
          the most important thing is he should be devoted to Krishna. His faith will save Arjuna’s
          soul." But Oppenheimer, seemingly, was
          never able to achieve this peace. “In some sort of crude sense which no vulgarity, no
          humor, no overstatements can quite
          extinguish,” he said, two years after the Trinity explosion, “the physicists have known
          sin; and this is a knowledge which they
          cannot lose.”</p>


        <p>“He doesn’t seem to believe that the soul is eternal, whereas Arjuna does,”
          says Thompson. “The fourth argument in the Gita is really
          that death is an illusion, that we’re not born and we don’t die. That’s the philosophy,
          really. That there’s only one consciousness
          and that the whole of creation is a wonderful play.” Oppenheimer, perhaps, never believed
          that the people killed in Hiroshima and
          Nagasaki would not suffer. While he carried out his work dutifully, he could never
          accept that this could liberate him from the
          cycle of life and death. In stark contrast, Arjuna realizes his error and decides
          to join the battle.</p>


        <p>“Krishna is saying you have to simply do your duty as a warrior,” says Thompson.
          “If you were a priest you wouldn’t have to do this,
          but you are a warrior and you have to perform it. In the larger scheme of things,
          presumably, the bomb represented the path of the
          battle against the forces of evil, which were epitomized by the forces of fascism.”</p>


        <p>For Arjuna, it may have been comparatively easy to be indifferent to war because
          he believed the souls of his opponents would live
          on regardless. But Oppenheimer felt the consequences of the atomic bomb acutely.
          “He hadn’t got that confidence that the destruction,
          ultimately, was an illusion,” says Thompson. Oppenheimer’s apparent inability to
          accept the idea of an immortal soul would always
          weigh heavy on his mind.</p>
