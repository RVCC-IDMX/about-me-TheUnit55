# About-Me Juan

## Description

This project serves as a personal web page to introduce myself to the world of web development. Through creating this project, I have honed my skills in various areas:

- **HTML**: Structured the content of the web page.
- **CSS**: Applied styling rules to bring life to the HTML structure, learning about responsive design, color schemes, and CSS animations.
- **JavaScript**: Enhanced the interactivity of the web page

The project showcases my journey as a developer and includes sections such as a biography, hobbies, a gallery, and contact information.
I also created a slide show for my hobbies with their own html and sumarries with buttons going foward, back and to home.

## Color Scheme

The color scheme of this project was based on a color scheme I feel really makes things flow and pop. Below are the major colors used throughout the site, along with their RGB and Hex codes:

- **Primary Color (e.g., Sky Blue)**
  - RGB: `98, 144, 252`
  - Hex: `#6290FC`
  

- **Secondary Color (e.g., Pumpkin Orange)**
  - RGB: `239, 97, 10`
  - Hex: `#EF610A`
  

- **Accent Color (e.g., Dark Gray)**
  - RGB: `51, 51, 51`
  - Hex: `#333333`
  

These colors were chosen to ensure good contrast and readability while providing a visually appealing design.
