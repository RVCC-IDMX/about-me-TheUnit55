 <h1>Can you hear the music</h1>   

<p><strong>J. Robert Oppenheimer (born Julius Robert Oppenheimer; /ˈɒpənhaɪmər/ OP-ən-hy-mər; 
April 22, 1904 – February 18, 1967) was an American theoretical physicist and director
 of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II. He is often 
 called the "father of the atomic bomb".</strong>

    <em>Born in New York City, Oppenheimer earned a bachelor of arts degree in chemistry
 from Harvard University in 1925 and a doctorate in physics from the University of
Göttingen in Germany in 1927,</em> where he studied under Max Born. After research at
other institutions, he joined the physics department at the University of California,
Berkeley, where he became a full professor in 1936. He made significant contributions 
to theoretical physics, including achievements in quantum mechanics and nuclear physics
 such as the Born–Oppenheimer approximation for molecular wave functions, work on the
  theory of electrons and positrons, the Oppenheimer–Phillips process in nuclear
fusion, and early work on quantum tunneling. With his students, <strong><em>he also made
 contributions to the theory of neutron stars and black holes, quantum field theory,
  and the interactions of cosmic rays.</em></strong></p>
